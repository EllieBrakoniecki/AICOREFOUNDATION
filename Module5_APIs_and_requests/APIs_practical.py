# %% Pagination
# - Using the StackExchange API find the first 5 pages of posts from this month
# - Keep the page size small using a query string param to avoid being restricted for making too many requests
# - Hint, what does the "page" query param do? What is on the "Paging" section of the website?
# - create a function which gets all of the responses from an endpoint by paginating through them (essentially put your solution above in a function)

# pagesize = no of posts per page
# page = page number (first 5 pages = pages 1-5)
